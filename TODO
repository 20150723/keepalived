* Insert LDAP, FTP, SSH, IMAP, POP, RADIUS checkers.
* Add minimum configuration verification (realserver must have
  a checker defined, ...)
* documentation:
	- hackers guide
	- code documentation
	- users guide
* code cleanup:
	- name space cleanup
	- function returnval check
	- maybe put *.h files into a ../include directory
	- maybe add a ../healthcheck directory for the checks
* more choice with parameters, less hardcoded values:
	- a general.conf could help, stuff like timeouts and so on
* functionality:
	- better startup check mechanism to prevent long debugging sessions
	- hooks for external checktools. For node-failover
	- a VTYSH to administrate keepalived on the fly
	- something I forgot right now :)
