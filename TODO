Whatever you want !

ipvs_group_range_cmd() appears nonsense, and inet_stor returning a uint8_t
doesn't work for IPv6. The virtual_service_entry_t thing needs range to be
uint32_t. Why would mask be 0xffffffff for IPv6?

ip_vs_daemon_kern vs /usr/include/linux/ip_vs.h ip_vs_daemon_user

vrrp_timer_fd should return 0 if an fd's timer is in the past?

Make vrrp->send_buffer a single buffer for all

Check timers passto to thread_... functions are reasonable, and stacktrace if not.

In function socket_state, should thread_add_write use timer_long() or -timer_long()

vrrp_timer_fd() - see comment

In thread functions with a timer, ensure not > LONG_MAX (or even some lower value);

Change tcp_socket_state etc to socket_state etc

Add noreturn function attribute on stop_vrrp/check

bin/genhash -s 2001:470:69dd:35::188 --port 80 -u /Harriet/     # works, but
bin/genhash -s 2001:470:69dd:35::188 --port 80 -u /Harriet/     # -S doesn;t
                                                                # but -S is OK with IPv4 address

in ipvswrapper.c, get rid of static srule etc and make them procedure local and pass as parameters

Stop passing base_ifp to netlink3_set_interface_parameters() etc

ipsecah issues
==============
1. sync and vmac ignore counter

2. Start up just after master dies, but have lowest priority so become master with counter == 1

3. cycle won't happen

4. In vrrp_backup, don't check auth type matches

5. ? if cycle becomes set, we must become backup. How do we get out of state?

Interfaces going down
======================

1. Interface goes down
	VMACs removed
	IP addresses removed
	IP routes using dev removed

2. Address removed
	IP routes using address removed

3. VMAC removed

4. IP Route removed

When interface comes back up:
1. Recreate VMACs
2. Add back static routes and addresses

Add "required" against against routes/addresses

Add id for static routes:
static_routes FRED {
...
}
and in vrrp instance
track_static_routes {
    FRED
}

and similarly for static_ipaddress

Add global keyword
  track_added
to make vrrp instances go to backup or fault state if anything they added goes away
(backup if can re-add, fault it not).

Add option `track` to virtual route to do same as global track_added, but for
that route for that vrrp instance. If route has a dev, then 

Add option track for virtual ip address, which will add specified dev to tracked interfaces.

Add options at static config level and vrrp instance to track system ip addresses and track system routes
(although this is crudely available via scripts).


epoll
=====
Use timerfd (see timerfd_create(2)) for microsecond timing with epoll, and do not bother with its timeout.
If not available, then simply use the epoll timer.

Optimise calls to timer_now() and see set_time_now()
====================================================
After select completes, get time. Before calculating next
select expire time, get time again.
To test time processing, save time after select and log time taken
before next select. Also initialise timer at startup.

Add api
=======

Add a file_watch as an option for a track_script
================================================

Add pipe for updates
====================
track_script like for absolute or relative priority

Done
====
1. Don't recreate entire VRRP packet each time.
